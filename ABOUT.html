        <h1>WHAT IS MINCRAFT?</h1>
        <h2>Minecraft is a multi-player game
            adventure game. You are
            given a hollow virtual world with which you
            can build things. You can explore the world
            and use the building blocks of the game
            (wooden planks, stone, dirt, quarts, sand, etc) to
            create nearly anything you can imagine - from
            castles, Houses, to rollercoasters, to cities to
            replicating your own garden or house
            even your own town! The possibilities are endless.</h2><br><br>

           
<h2>Survival – after randomly being spawned in a new world, players have to try and survived by gathering material, building shelter, gaining experience, and fighting off hostile mobs.
Creative – a game mode where players have immediate access to almost all blocks and items, are invulnerable & immunes to death, and have the ability to fly. The purpose of this game mode is to create / design unique worlds.
Adventure – players interact with objects (levers, buttons) and mobs to complete an adventure.
Spectator – Invisible to everything and cannot interact with blocks, entities, or your inventory. This mode is typically used to observe other player’s created worlds.
Hardcore – Similar to survival mode, Hardcore is set to the “hard” difficulty level permanently and players cannot respawn; once you die, the map is deleted (or you permanently become a spectator).
