      <div>WHAT IS A WILDFIRE?</div><br><br>
      <div>A wildfire, wildland fire or rural fire is an uncontrolled fire in an area of vegetation happening in rural areas. Wildfires can rapidly burn millions of acres of land and can destroy everything—trees, homes, animals and humans in their paths. Families and whole communities that live in rural, wildfire-prone areas are in danger of losing their homes and having to flee for their own safety. Wildfires also have major health hazards, especially for people with existing breathing problems. Breathing fire smoke can cause respiratory issues and coughing, wheezing and bronchitis. Another threat is carbon monoxide (CO). Inhaling CO reduces oxygen delivery to the body’s organs and tissues and can lead to headaches, nausea, dizziness and even premature death.

    <div>DOES CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSE MORE WILDFIRES?</div><br><br>
    <div>A firefighter in a forest fire Climate change increases the occurrence and severity of wildfires. Hotter weather, a result of climate change, makes forests and vegetation drier and therefore more prone to burning. As a result, the average wildfire season is three and a half months longer than it was a few decades ago, and the number of annual large fires in the West has tripled. As rising greenhouse gas emissions are increasing droughts and heat, more catastrophic wildfires are expected in the years to come, especially with the fire seasons getting longer.</div>
